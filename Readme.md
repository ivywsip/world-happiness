# World Happiness

World Happiness Report is an annual analysis published by United Nation based on Gallup World Poll survery, in which on average 1000 citizen in each country are asked to evaluate their happiness in six different aspects of life. Based on the survey result, a happiness score for each country is calculated, on a scale from 0 to 10 (best possible life). The project goal is to find out how the global citizens are doing in terms of happiness and what contribute to their happiness.

As inspired by the legendary theory Maslow's Pyramid of Needs, a hierachy illustrating the priority of human motivation and needs, we will gather some national level indicators based on the categories from this pyramid, and measure the relationships of those indicators with the happiness scores in world happiness report, in hopes of finding out what factors and how they contribute to the life evaluation of a citizen.

## Hypotheses: 
1. Indicators corresponding to categories in the lower level of the pyramid of needs will have a stronger coorelation with happiness score.
2. An improvement of the indicators corresponding to categories in the lower level of the pyramid will have a higher impact on the increase of happiness score, compared to those categories in a higher level.


## Project Outlines:
1.  World Happiness Report - Data exploration
    - Explore the trend of happiness score and global rankings of happiness score in 2018. 
2. Experiment with Maslow's Pyramid of Needs
    - Explore the correlations among national level indicators with happiness score. 
3. Modelling
    - Develop model of happiness contributors and compare model with pyramid of needs.
